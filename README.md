# hello there!
## welcome to DataNode

this is my simple website DataNode, to temporarily store and transfer 📭 data<br>
it's an easy-to-use, sharable storage solution which looks **modern** and **simple** through *nodes*

although currently a work-in-progress, it may, in the future be released for early access ⚙️<br>
hopefully it won't be monetised, but there will likely be monetisation for more and different 📦 *nodes* 📤


🥳 God bless, and have a good day! 😁
